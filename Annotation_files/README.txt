1- Genomic Source: Okuno et al., 2016

The assembled genome sequences of Saccharomyces pastorianus strains CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538 and WS34/70 have been downloaded from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJDB4073/

Files: CBS1503.fasta, CBS1513.fasta, CBS1538.fasta and WS34_70.fasta

2- We structurally annotated the four S. pastorianus strains using the Yeast Genome Annotation Pipeline (Proux-WÃ©ra et al., 2012)

3- We extracted using a Python 3.6 script we developped all the ORFs sequences
