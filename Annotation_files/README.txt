1- Genomic Source: Okuno et al., 2016

The assembled genome sequences of Saccharomyces pastorianus strains CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538 and WS34/70 have been downloaded from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJDB4073/

Files: 
- CBS1503.fasta
- CBS1513.fasta
- CBS1538.fasta
- WS34_70.fasta

2- We structurally annotated the four S. pastorianus strains using the Yeast Genome Annotation Pipeline (Proux-WÃ©ra et al., 2012)

3- We extracted using a Python 3.6 script we developped all the ORFs sequences, and stored them in new FASTA files
Files: 
- CBS1503_orf.fasta
- CBS1513_orf.fasta
- CBS1538_orf.fasta
- WS3470_orf.fasta

4- We applied HybridMine pipeline to the four strains, containing the parental allele name for all the genes identified as inherited from a parent.

5- We generated annotation files in GFF3 format. The files have been zipped due to their size.
